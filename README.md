<h1>Expense Tracker</h1>

My Portfolio Project 2 is an Expense Tracker made to manage personal expenses for people who wish to keep a track of their expenses and calculate how much they would have remaining.

## **Project Overview**

As someone who often micromanages my expenses, I thought an Expense Tracker would be a great idea to make using JavaScript for my second Portfolio Project. 
The UI is very simple where the user can input how much income they have made in the month, track their expenses with further details, and find out how much they have remaining every time. 

### ** Goals**
  * A simple UI that is easy to read and understand
  * Use of Javascript without issues for usability
  * Fast performance
  * Accessible

## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

The background colour used in this page is a green with a blue undertone with the background for the body being white with the same colour as accents to highlight the important features.

The colour choice was inspired because of myself being a fan of colour theory, I looked into colours that are best associated with finance and money. 

Green is often associated with money as it subconsciously gives the feeling of wealth. It also represents harmony thus making people feel calm. I wanted to use green to give this feeling, however, I found that a lot of the main shades of green were too jarring. 

I then found that blue is the next most popular colour when it comes to money as it represents trust. This helped me decide on a colour for my site as I was then able to use a green with blue undertones to represent both colours.

### **Typography**

The font used was Raleway from Google Fonts. It was suggested via research that serif fonts were the best type of fonts to use when it came to dealing with finances on a computer. 

### **Imagery**

For the icon, I used a simple wallet icon from Font Awesome to represent expenses.

### **Structure**
  * The Expense Tracker was structured to be user friendly and easy to understand at first glance.
  * With the large and eye-catching header, the user is able to understand what the page is about and its purpose.
  * At the top of the main body, there is a form to put in the income amount.
  * The user can input the name of the transaction, amount, transaction type, and date of payment.
  * The transaction type is a dropdown box for people who are interested in knowing what sort of transaction was made.
  * There are 'Add' and 'Remove' buttons to the right of the page so users can add any more expenses they have made or remove anything they do not need.
  * Once filled in, if the user selects 'Calculate!', they are able to see their expense total and total remaining.
  * The user doesn't have to fill out every part of the form to get their aquired results, however, if people like to micromanage their expenses, this site is able to assist with that.
  * The footer includes my LinkedIn and GitHub links along with the copyright for the page.

## **Features**

All features are fully responsive on all devices and screen widths.

* Add button works as intended and the Calculate button runs the task

* The Remove button can remove any line if required. Example shows top row from previous example removed.

* As mentioned, not every detail has to be filled in if the user is only looking to do a quick calculation via numbers.

* And there is no limit to how many transactions you want to add.

## **Testing**

* I tested this on Chrome and Safari as well as on other devices such as iPad and phones. All functions work as intended and the structure is still sound.

* There were no errors for the HTML using the W3C Validator or for the CSS using the Jigsaw Validator.

## **Credits**

I am very thankful to have a partner who is a full stack developer and has a job where JavaScript is mainly used. He was able to teach me how to code the language properly and test my program for me for which I am super thankful.
